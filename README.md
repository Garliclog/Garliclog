### Hi there 👋

If you're here you're either intrested in my work, a potential employer, or lost. Either one os quite worrying for me so I'll keep this short.

-👏 Software / Games Programmer
Depending on how far into the future you're reading this, I'll either have some basic applications posted or I'll have some game demos available on this page.
I intend to keep this repository mainly for displaying my skill set and hope to keep it updated as my experience grows.

-💪 Prefered line of work
As of writing, I'm currently employed as a low-code developer for a small company. 
I use a platform called Zoho Creator to develop a system that my employers can use to better manage the company.
While I have no complaints with the job, and I'm more than happy with any form of sotware development work, my ideal line of work would be in the games industry.

-👨‍💻 I have experience with programming in the following languages
  - Deluge
  - C#
  - Python
  - C++

-🐱‍💻 Projects I'm currently working on
I'm currently working on creating a library of simple scripts and applications that I can upload to this repository to display my level of knowledge.
I also hope to begin development of a simple mobile game in the coming months that will hopefully be released on the google playstore.

-📞 Contact
If you need to contact me, it's likely you'll already have my contact details,
but if not, you're more than welcome to DM me via Discord @ Garliclog#6669


Thanks for checking this out 🔥
